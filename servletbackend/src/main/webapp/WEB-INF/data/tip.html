<p><strong>Ayurveda - Keep Heart healthy</strong></p>
<p>Research studies have linked sleep deprivation to blood pressure problems, depression and other factors that increase the risk of heart disease. Ayurveda considers sleep just as important as diet in maintaining health. Practice good bedtime habits: favor restful, calming activities as bedtime draws near to help disconnect the mind from the senses. Keep your bedroom clear of distractions: television, computers, other work-related material. Maintain a temperature that is comfortable. Stay away from stimulants in the evening. Go to bed by 10 PM. Early to bed and early to rise still works to keep you healthy and energetic through the day.

<h4>Ayurveda - Keep Heart healthy</h4>
<p>In Ayurveda, your physical, mental and emotional characteristics clue you in to your dosha—one of the three energies that govern everyone and everything: vata (air), pitta (fire) and kapha (earth). Each of us is predominantly one "type" and we see optimal results when we make changes that jibe with our tendencies.</p>
<p>Vata type people need food that can help weigh them down a little. In contrast with other types, they often benefit from adding more fats into their diet (choose healthy monounsaturated fats, such as olive or flaxseed oils, or use ghee, clarified butter). You should choose foods that are warm, soupy or heavy; root vegetables are especially grounding. Avoid the salad bar, especially when stressed, as it features cold, dry, rough foods that make a vata feel unbalanced.</p>

<h4>Ayurveda and the Heart</h4>
<p>According to Ayurveda, the heart is one of the three main marmas (vital organs). There are many types of srotas (channels) responsible for the circulation of various materials like dhatus (tissues), energy, wastes and prana (life air). Prana vaha srotas, which are responsible for the flow of prana in the body, are the main srotas. The heart is the root of prana vaha srotas. All the main blood vessels originate from the heart. The heart is also the seat of the consciousness or soul.</p>
<p><strong>Taking care of your heart</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>According to Ayurveda, ama is the main cause for heart diseases. Ama is the toxic material that is produced by undigested food. Therefore, one must make sure that one eats only the amount and type of foods one can digest properly.</li>
	<li>Avoid over-eating and eating frequently. Eat a light breakfast and dinner. Lunch should be the main meal. Milk products, fried foods, cold foods and acidic foods should be taken in small quantities. White flour products, and foods that contain chemical preservatives and additives should be avoided. Animal products, especially red meat, are not good as they take a long time to be digested, and create a lot of toxins in the stomach.</li>

<p>Cardiovascular disease is often worsened by the experience of chronic stress. This is due to hormonal changes and other biochemical responses to stress that activate the cardiovascular system and place it under greater pressure. Stress can contribute to many of the risk factors of cardiovascular disease including hypertension, poor eating habits, weakened digestion, slow elimination and increased cigarette smoking.</p>
<p>Scientific research on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendental_Meditation">Transcendental Meditation</a> (TM) program shows it to create virtually the opposite physiological effect of chronic stress and reduce many of the risk factors of cardiovascular disease. It is highly recommended that you practice the TM technique regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Defend Yourself against Common Cold cough</strong><br/><br/>
Strengthen your immune system and keep yourself healthy. Cold weather, stress, lack of sleep and poor nutrition can damage your immune system and increase susceptibility to viruses. Two plants that will help you strengthen your immune system are aamla and tulsi.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aamla">Aamla</a> is the highest natural source of vitamin C, containing about 1000 mg per 100g. This is so even in dried powder. Recent clinical tests have shown that vitamin C in aamla is more quickly assimilated by the body than the synthetic vitamins. Two to three tablespoonfuls of fresh juice of aamla or half to one teaspoonful of powder of the same is ideal.</li>
	<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulsi">Tulsi</a>, on the other hand, is heat-generating in action and is useful in respiratory infections. Its anti-bacterial, anti-tubercular, anti-asthmatic and anti-inflammatory effects have been confirmed in recent times. Leaves of this plant, mixed with an equal quantity of dried ginger powder, form an excellent substitute for tea during cold and flu. This may be taken by adding milk and sugar three times a day.</li>

<p>If a cold has persisted for three or four days, your throat, sinuses, and lungs may be severely inflamed. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlegm">phlegm</a> is thick and your chest feels tight and sore. Then, try these remedies:
<ul>
	<li>If you are unable to sneeze or blow nose to open the blocked passage, then, here’s solution. A powder made of equal parts of cinnamon, black pepper, cardamoms and the seeds of Nigella sativa (krishna jeeraka) is to be taken as a snuff.</li>
	<li>To stop a running nose, you can apply the paste made of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutmeg">nutmeg</a> (jaiphal) and cow’s milk along with a little opium on the nose and forehead.</li>
	<li>Black pepper and long pepper, taken along with dried ginger, is supposed to help chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane, such as those lining the throat, sinuses, and lungs. During cold and flu, the body loses moisture, and mucous becomes thick and difficult to expel. Thick mucous provides a place for germs to multiply. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_(genus)#As_medicine_and_stimulant">Trikatu</a>, the combination of the above three, can help by keeping the mucous in the lungs wet and fluid-like, and decreasing inflammation of the respiratory tract. You can take half a teaspoonful of trikatu powder mixed with honey.

<h4>Ayurveda and cough, cold </h4>
<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is it a cold or the flu?</strong><br/> A cold and the flu (also called influenza) are alike in many ways. But the flu can sometimes lead to more serious problems, like the lung disease pneumonia. A stuffy nose, sore throat, and sneezing are usually the signs of a cold. Tiredness, fever, headache, and major aches and pains probably mean you have the flu. Coughing can be a sign of either a cold or the flu. But a bad cough usually points to the flu.</p>
<p><strong>How to avoid getting a cold?</strong><br/> Wash your hands often. You can pick up cold germs easily, even when shaking someone’s hand or touching doorknobs or handrails. Avoid people with colds when possible. If you sneeze or cough, do it into a tissue and then throw the tissue away. Clean surfaces you touch with a germ-killing disinfectant. Do not Touch your nose, eyes or mouth. Germs can enter your body easily by these paths</p>

<p><strong>Prevention and Self Care</strong>: There are several ways in which you can keep the infection levels low:
<ul>
	<li>Keep away from others who are infected with cold.</li>
	<li>Wash your hands often. Turning a door knob or picking up a telephone recently touched by someone with a cold may infect your system, particularly if you rub your eyes or nose afterwards. The eyes and nose, rather than the mouth, are the most frequent routes for infection.</li>

	<li>Take plenty of hot beverages. If you like hot chicken soup, have it. These substances open clogged nasal passages and let you breathe more easily.</li>
    <li>Drink plenty of fluids. Inhale steam to relieve a stuffed nose. Fill a bowl with hot water, put a towel over your head to trap the steam and inhale for a few minutes at a time. You can add aromatic oils of your choice for added benefits.</li>
	<li>Get some fresh air-take a gentle walk.</li>
	<li>Do not overheat the room. Let the body lose heat naturally.</li>

<h4>Ayurvedic Skin Care Tips</h4>
<p>Genetically, we are wired to be attracted to people with clear skin and a glowing complexion because it's a sign of good health. Ayurveda has some time-proven tricks to make your skin clear, soft, and radiant without spending a fortune or loading up on chemicals.</p>
<p>First, let's see why our skin tends to become rough, dry, and irritated during certain seasons and with age. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayurveda">Ayurveda</a>, it happens due to the accumulation of Vata in the body. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vata">Vata</a> predominates in the Fall and early Winter, and in people over the age of 50. When there is excess Vata, we are prone to dry skin, cracking joints, thinning dry hair, and brittle nails. Vata can also show up in the body earlier if you're really stressed, have a Vata disturbing diet or live in a Vata inducing climate (cold and dry). The secret to staying young is keeping Vata at bay.</p>

<p>Here are some Ayurvedic tips that will slow down Vata accumulation in the body and will help you stay young and keep your skin beautiful.</p>
<p><ul>
	<li><strong>Don't Skip the Veggies</strong> - Stick to high-water content vegetables that are easier to digest, such as lettuce, carrot, cucumber, daikon radish (which is revered by Ayurvedic healers for its purifying properties), fennel, and tender asparagus tips. These vegetables are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridosha">tridoshic</a>: they are good for all types of skin. Combine at least 3 and enjoy with a simple olive oil-lemon juice dressing</li>
	<li><strong>Eat Like a Bird</strong> - Both traditional and Ayurvedic medicine agree that adding seeds and nuts into your diet will improve the condition of your skin. Vata is drying by nature so all foods that have natural healthy fats in them will prevent this imbalance. Nuts and seeds are a perfect food -- they contain Omega-3s, healthy fats, and fiber to help a weakened Vata digestion. You can also try adding almonds, sunflower seeds, flax seeds, and other nuts to your oatmeal (or having them as your afternoon snack, when Vata naturally predominates).   </li>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Breathe In and Release</strong> - High levels of emotional and mental stress is one of the major reasons why Vata gets aggravated. It literally sucks out all the vital juices from your skin making it dehydrated. Meditation and breathing can be very effective stress busters that you might want to consider. To get started with yogic breathing, lie on your back or seat comfortably, place one palm on your belly, and another one on your chest. Start inhaling into your belly, letting it slightly rise, then keep inhaling into your ribs, expanding the ribcage up and out, letting the air completely fill up your lungs by inhaling all the way up into your chest. Mentally keep track of your breathing -- your belly, ribs, and chest. On your exhales, let the air move in the opposite order -- chest, ribs,and  belly sinking in. Do this simple yet very effective breathing technique for 5-10 minutes when you need to calm down whether it is before an important meeting or right before you fall asleep</li>

	<li><strong>Take Skin Moisturizer to a New Level</strong> - Staying hydrated on the inside is important but you shouldn't forget about taking care of your skin from the outside, as well. Cleansing and moisturizing are the most crucial to keeping your skin healthy and young. An oil massage is the best remedy for dry skin.  For the best absorption, anti-aging oil massages should be done at night. Apricot oil applied 2-3 times a week at night makes my skin feel very smooth and healthy. Once a week give yourself (or ask your partner to give you) a full body massage with oil. It stimulates healthy blood circulation, lymph drainage, reduces water retention. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abhyangha">Abhyanga</a>, a full body oil massage, calms the mind, leaving you feeling grounded yet focused and alert, and balances emotions. Using natural organic oils is also a lot cheaper than chemical-loaded lotions found at a pharmacy. Try these Ayurvedic oils for your specific dosha: Kapha, Pitta, or Vata. </li>

<p>
<strong>Almond Joy</strong><br/>

Another simple potion is a paste of warm water and almond meal, which contains fatty acids that help keep skin smooth. (Don't use hot water; it strips skin of its natural protective oils.) Making the almond meal is easy: Use a food processor, blender, or coffee grinder to pulverize raw organic almonds into a fine powder. (Be sure to pulse the mixture for a few seconds and then pause, so you don't end up with almond butter.) Refrigerate the powder in a clean glass jar. It will keep for about three weeks.</p>

<p>When you're ready to use it, pour a teaspoonful into your palm, add a little warm water, and blend that with your finger to make a paste. Smooth it onto your face, massaging in gentle circles to enhance circulation and exfoliate dead skin cells. Then rinse with warm water and moisturize as you usually do.</p>

<p>To smooth rough elbows, knees, and feet, mix together two parts mung- or garbanzo-bean flour with one part full-fat organic yogurt. Let this mixture sit in a bowl for 10 minutes, then massage it with circular motions into your rough spots. Let it dry, and leave it on your skin for 30 minutes or so. Rinse with water, and then do your usual moisturizing routine.

<h4>Ayurvedic Skin Care Tips</h4>
<p><strong>Vata Skin Care</strong><br/></p>
<p>For Vata skin to stay youthful, skin care products used should be very nurturing. They must include some essential oils or herbs in combination, which can nourish the skin and rehydrate it, otherwise it may be susceptible to wrinkles and premature aging.</p>
<p>Going to bed on time, eating regular meals, and following a regular daily routine are essential components of a holistic approach to Vata skin care, as are eating foods that help balance Vata and nourish the Vata skin.</p>
<p><strong>Suggestions for caring for Vata skin</strong><br/></p>
<p>Vata skin types, for instance, will want to eat more warm, unctuous foods and favor the sweet, sour and salty tastes to balance the dry, rough, moving Vata dosha. Provide added nourishment to your skin by including organic milk, whole grains and green leafy vegetables in your diet. Drink lots of lukewarm water everyday for internal hydration. Eat plenty of sweet juicy fruits, they help cleanse the body from within and provide hydration as well. Include a little healthy fat such as Ghee (clarified butter) or olive oil in your diet for added lubrication. A warm oil self-massage is excellent for keeping skin lubricated. Use a gentle, all-natural moisturizer to keep facial skin hydrated. Provide added deep lipid support with facial oil. Get plenty of rest so your mind as well as your body have the opportunity to recharge. Use a gentle, moisture-balancing cleanser and splash your face with water several times when you cleanse.</p>

<h4>Skin Care in Ayurveda</h4>

<p><strong>Pitta Skin Care</strong><br/>

The Pitta skin type needs both cooling and nurturing. Use skin care products that help enhance resistance to the sun. Avoid tanning treatments and therapies that expose your delicate, sensitive skin to steam for extended periods of time.</p>

<p>The ayurvedic herb Flame of Forest can help protect Pitta skin from photosensitivity. But like other ayurvedic herbs, it needs to be used in combination with other herbs for a balanced effect on the skin.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions for caring for Pitta skin:</strong><br/>

If you have a Pitta skin type you will thrive on sweet, bitter and astringent tastes, as found in sweet, juicy fruits, rose petal preserve, and cooked greens. Avoid hot, spicy foods. Stay away from harsh, synthetic cosmetics; they can damage your sensitive skin and cause breakouts. Avoid hot spicy foods and an excess of deep-fried foods, they add heat to an already fiery constitution. Eat lots of sweet juicy fruits and have some rose petal jam in cool milk every day. The rose is considered cooling for mind, body and emotions. Use cooling oil, such as coconut oil, for the daily massage. Cook with cooling spices such as fennel and licorice. Take extra care to protect your skin when you go out in the sun. Use gentle, natural skin care products for cleansing and moisturizing. Provide added lipid support, such as facial skin oil, every other day.</p>

<h4>Skin Care in Ayurveda</h4>

<p><strong>Kapha Skin Care</strong><br/>

Kapha skin, because of its thickness and oiliness, is more prone to accumulate ama -- toxins under the skin. People with Kapha skin need to do detoxification on a regular basis, both internal detoxification and external detoxification to flush toxins from the skin

Scrubbing the skin with a gentle exfoliating clay can help external cleansing. Kapha skin types may also need to take herbal formulations to cleanse the skin from within.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions for caring for Kapha skin:</strong><br/>

The oiliness of Kapha type skin calls for a diet that is warmer, lighter, less oily, and free of heavy, hard to digest foods. Eating more bitter, astringent and pungent tastes help stimulate digestion and balance Kapha skin.Avoid too many sweet foods or deep-fried foods, they add to the oiliness in the skin. Exercise everyday to improve circulation. A daily warm oil massage can also help circulation. Eat plenty of organic vegetables and fruits to help cleanse the body from within. Cleanse your skin twice everyday; exfoliate with a mud-mask at least once a week. Cook with warming spices such as ginger and black pepper to stoke the digestive fire and inhibit the accumulation of ama inside the body.</p>

<h4>Treatment for skin disease:</h4>

<p>The holistic management of health problems in ayurved comprises the three fold scientific approach towards diseases through diet, lifestyle and medicine</p>

<p>Ayurveda has stated that skin diseases occur primarily due to sluggish liver function, which leads Pitta and Kapha Dosha dysfunction when toxins build up and the liver is overwhelmed, then the impurities show up in break-outs and other skin problems.</p>

<p>Another vital factor that contributes to healthy appearance is the clean bowel: hence the need for regular and complete bowel evacuation. In order to achieve this, a mild laxative like Trifala and a light diet are advisable if one suffers from constipation.</p>

<p>Also, be sure to drink lots of water throughout the day to help flush out the impurities. In spring you can sip hot water to help melt the ama (digestive impurities) that have accumulated.</p>

<p>Scientifically treatments have been classified as shodhana & shamana.</p>

<h4>Nourishment for skin</h4>

<p>Besides following the diet for your skin type, following foods are terrific skin-enhancers: leafy green vegetables; easily digested proteins such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paneer">paneer</a>, milk, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tofu">tofu</a>, sunflower seeds; foods high in zinc such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinoa">quinoa</a>; and beta-carotene-rich foods such as carrots and sweet cherries. Almonds and walnuts support the skin with their protein and lubricating fat content. Some skin-friendly spices include turmeric to nourish the first four layers of the skin; cumin to rid the body of ama; black pepper to cleanse the channels, and fennel to balance the transformational ability of the skin. All antioxidant-rich fruits and vegetables, such as pomegranate, apple, pear, and bitter, green leafy vegetables are also excellent for the skin. Eat only fresh, whole and organic foods. Stay away from packaged, canned, frozen, processed, and packaged foods.</p>

<h4>Skin Care in Ayurveda</h4>

<p><strong>Effect of stress on skin</strong><br/>
<p>There are three types of stress, and all three impact the skin in different ways.</p>

<p>Mental stress starts a chain reaction that ends in a drying out the moisture in the skin. Thinning, dryness and the shrinking of the 'shrotasa' (microchannels) that carry nutritive fluid to the skin result in wrinkles and stress lines. 
Emotional stress also affects the skin-just notice how anger or embarrassment can turn your face red. This shows the connection between emotions and the skin. If emotional stress becomes chronic, the result is acne, sun sensitivity, and other Pitta-based problems.
Physical stress: Exercising too much, working too much, or straining the body over a period of time causes physical stress. This causes the drying out of skin moisture and rough, aged skin.</p>

<p>To counteract mental stress, maintain a Vata-pacifying diet and daily routine. To bring emotional stress into balance, follow a Pitta-pacifying diet and routine. For physical stress, try to limit exercise or work to fifty percent of your physical stamina.</p>

<h4>Tips for healthy hair and skin</h4>
<p><ul>
	<li>Use sunscreen everyday even if you are indoors - the sun's UVA rays come through windows too and contribute to aging, pigmenting and tanning.</li>
	<li>Sunscreen should have an SPF of 30 or more. SPF is the degree of protection against UVB rays, hence sunscreen must have UVA protection as well. The usual UVA protection ingredients are Avobenzone, Titanium dioxide, Zinc oxide, Mexoryl and Tinosorb.</li>

<h4>Tips for healthy hair and skin</h4>
<p><ul>
	<li>It is advisable to use mild skin lightening creams as prevention. Look for botanical ingredients like Arbutin, Bear-berry, Licorice, Mulberry, Ginseng, Gingko, Emblica, Turmeric - curcuma, Grapeseed and vitamins like C and A, and Niacin-amide.</li>
	<li>Aging can be intrinsic, i.e. genetic, and can be delayed by exercise and, to a lesser extent, through diet. Extrinsic factors include increased UV intensity, increased pollution as well as stress. All these factors tend to dry the skin and make it more prone to pigmentation and aging. Hence it is important to start caring for your skin in your teens.</li>
	<li>Extrinsic factors produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are naughty oxygen molecules that damage the cells and make them age faster. Anti-oxidants neutralize these ROS.</li>
	<li>At night, use a moisturizer with an age-protecting agent.</li>

<h4>Tips for healthy hair and skin</h4>
<p><ul>
	<li>For younger skin, look for ingredients with antioxidants like vitamins C, E or a whole range of botanical like green tea, grape-seed or pomegranate extract, cur-cumin etc. You might also like to look out for the following: Genistein, ECGC, Resveratrol, Idebenone and Coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10.</li>
	<li>For older skin, look for the following ingredients: peptides, vitamin A and derivatives like retinol and other retinoids, Alpha, beta and polyhydroxy acids.</li>
	<li>Exfoliation should be done with extreme caution and only with modern bead exfoliators. Avoid granular scrubs as these tend to damage the skin microscopically, which can lead to slow, insidious and patchy darkening.</li>

<h4>Tips that Will Make Your Skin Glow</h4>

<p><strong>Use Green Tea</strong><br/>
The health benefits of green tea are bountiful, extending to improvements in oral health, odor, arthritis, cancer risks, diabetes, heart disease, weight control and blood pressure. Green tea is also excellent at boosting skin health, with documented effectiveness at reducing risks for skin cancer, managing psoriasis and eczema, reducing inflammation, slowing the signs of aging and reducing the incidence and severity of breakouts. Most of these impressive health benefits come from the polyphenols, catechins, which are found in high concentrations in the leaves of tea. These catechins are powerful antioxidants that are useful weapons against free radicals. Our favorite way to creatively incorporate green tea in our diet is via these two recipes: Beginner Green Tea Smoothie and Green Tea Mango Sandwiches.

<h3>FAQ - Healthy Skin</h3>
<p><strong>What role does Ayurveda play in skin care?</strong></p>
<p>First, Ayurveda divides the skin into one of three types: Vata, which is more dry; Pitta, which is more sensitive; and Kapha, which is more oily. In Ayurveda, diet plays a very big role in skin health, so we emphasize proper nutrition and digestion. For those with Vata (or dry) skin, it’s important to avoid eating dry, cold foods and instead try to consume warm and oily foods. For those with Pitta (or sensitive) skin, it’s important to avoid spicy foods, and instead focus on fruits and astringent foods. And for those with Kapha (or oily) skin, it’s best to avoid oily foods and instead consume dry foods like grains and vegetables. The point is to try and balance the system.</p>

<h3>FAQ - Healthy Skin</h3>
<p><strong> What kinds of treatments are typical in Ayurvedic skin care?</strong></p>
<p>We believe that stress and strain play a big role in skin health, so the first thing we might do is prescribe meditation, yoga and more sleep. But there are also a series of more specific, topical treatments – and they’re all completely natural. Ground cumin seed mixed with a little water to make a paste – worn as a face mask – is a very good treatment for acne. For uneven pigmentation, make a paste of basil leaves. For wrinkles or dry skin, a mask made of fresh papaya and a little coconut oil is great. For sensitive skin, sandalwood powder can be mixed with milk. Each of these can be made fresh once a week and applied to the skin for around 30 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Preventing Hair Loss through Ayurveda</strong><br/></p>
 
<p>Hair is the most important cosmetic addition to our appearance. Since healthy hair is a sign of a healthy body, it is important for us to keep our hair silky, shiny and thick.</p>

<p>Everybody has experiences of hair loss sometime or the other in their lives. In medical terms, loss of hair is known as '<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alopecia">alopecia</a>'. Alopecia may be a sign of some underlying disease. It costs our beauty and thereby brings in a set of depressing emotions. </p>

<p><strong>Structure of Hair</strong></p>

<p>The hair on our scalp can be divided into two parts—the root and the shaft. The root of the hair is inside the skin (epidermis) of the scalp. Each hair root is surrounded by a pouch-like structure called follicle. The base of the hair root is in the shape of a bulb. This bulb is indented by capillaries and nerve fibres. Cell division takes place in the center of the bulb and the newly divided hair cells push the previous cells up. The cells which move upwards die slowly forming the hard hair shaft.</p>

<h4>Ayurveda and Hair Loss</h4>
 
<p><strong>Normal Cycle of Hair Growth</strong><br/></p>
 
<p>About 10% of the hair on the scalp is in a resting phase at any given time. The resting hair falls after 2 to 3 months and new hair starts to grow in its place. The growing phase continues for around 2.25 to 6 yrs. During this phase each hair grows approximately 1 cm per month. At any given time about 90% of the hair on the scalp is in the growing phase.</p>

<p>Normally, the dead hair decays at the rate of 70 to 80 strands per day. The rate of decay increases in the rainy and damp season. A rate of fall or decay greater than this is considered alarming and such a situation may be termed as hair loss.</p>

<h4>Ayurveda and Hair Loss</h4>
 
<p><strong>Ayurvedic Classification of Hair </strong></p>

<p>Ayurveda has classified the hair type according to the three basic body types—vata, pitta and kapha. According to Ayurveda, people falling under any of these body types have different hair features as per their doshas. Let us discuss the hair properties of people with respect to vata, pitta and kapha constitutions.</p>

<p><strong>Hair of People with Vata Constitution</strong></p>

<p>The hair of people with predominantly vata type of constitution is generally dark, coarse, wiry, inky, and frizzy. Such type of hair gets tangled easily and is prone to be dull with split ends. Such hair also has the possibility of dandruff infection.</p>

<p><strong>Hair of People with Pitta Constitution</strong></p>

<p>The hair of people with predominantly pitta type of constitution is generally brown, blonde, light, fine and silky. People with pitta constitution face problems like premature graying of hair and premature baldness. Such hair with a dominance of pitta tends to become oily particularly in hot and dry weather. This situation also leads to the dullness of hair.</p>

<p><strong>Hair of People with Kapha Constitution</strong></p>

<p>The hair of people with predominantly kapha type of constitution are generally dark or light, thick, heavy, wavy, and slightly oily. The hair of people with kapha constitution is lustrous.</p>

<h4>Ayurveda and Hair Loss</h4>
 
<p><strong>Causes of Hair Loss</strong></p>

<p>Hair is nourished by the nutrient plasma, which is produced by the metabolic processing of the food we consume. The healthy nutrient plasma is responsible for the nourishment of the hair. According to Ayurveda, excess of pitta dosha (heat) in the body is the chief cause of hair problems. There are various other reasons for hair loss as mentioned below:</p>

<p><ul>
	<li>Hormonal imbalance in men and women is an important cause of hair loss. In men, a high concentration of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in hair follicles causes hair fall. In women, hormonal imbalances both during pregnancy and after delivery cause hair fall.</li>
	<li>High amount of sebum in the scalp clogs the pores of the scalp and prevents nutrients from reaching the hair follicle, resulting in hair loss.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Ayurveda and Hair Loss</h4>

<p><strong>Cause of Hair Loss in Women</strong><br/></p>

<p>In Ayurveda, we have this way of understanding cellular nutrition through the layers of tissue. Ayurveda describes hair and nail tissue as a waste by-product tissue formed with healthy bone tissue (mala of the asthi dhatu). Now, the nerve tissue (majja dhatu) runs through the bone marrow. Put a low-grade, negative, low self esteem, or world-as-falling-apart vibe in your nerves and it’s going to vibrate the bones tissue into a depressed, sub-optimal state.</p>

<p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Lack of cellular nutrition in the bone tissue</strong></li> <br/> Lack of nutrition can reflect stress creating an sub-optimal state for cellular digestion and waste creation (hair in this case) in the bone cells. Besides stress, a simply not getting the best nutrients in the body and feces out of the whole body is a huge factor. The feces out of the body factor is huge.

<h3>Cause of Hair Loss in Women</h3>

<p><strong>Hereditary hair loss</strong><br/></p>

<p>The most common cause of hair loss in women is what we call Androgenetic Alopecia, also called Female Pattern Hair Loss (FPHL). This is an inherited condition in which you have certain genes which makes your hair susceptible to hair loss when exposed to the normal, small amount of androgens (male hormones) which all women have.</p>

<p>This gene can be inherited from either your mother or father's side of the family, though you're more likely to have it if both of your parents had hair loss. Bear in mind however, that if your mom and dad did not suffer from hair loss, it does NOT mean that you won't get it.</p>

<p>Understand that genetics can actually SKIP generations.They can skip 1, 2 or probably 3 generations in certain cases so if your grandmother or great grandmother of father had it, there's ALWAYS a possibility that YOU might get it too! Androgenic alopecia affects 40% of women at some point in their lifetime</p>

<p><strong>The symptoms:</strong> It normally starts over the top of your scalp, or starts thinning behind your bangs.</p>

<h3>Cause of Hair Loss in Women</h3>

<p><strong>Skin Conditions on your Scalp</strong><br/></p>

<p>An unhealthy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalp">scalp</a> can cause inflammation that makes it problematic for hair to grow. Skin conditions that lead to hair loss include dandruff, psoriasis, and fungal infections such as ringworm.</p>


<p><strong>The symptoms:</strong> Dandruff causes the scalp to shed its skin, so you'll notice greasy, yellowish scales on your shoulders or in your hair. It may be the result of yeast called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malassezia">Malassezia</a>, hormonal changes, or excess oil in the skin.</p>

<h3>Cause of Hair Loss in Women</h3>

<p><strong>Over-Styling</strong><br/></p>

<p>Too much shampooing, styling, and dyeing can harm your tresses. Heat and chemicals weaken the hair, causing it to break and fall out. Often, it's a combination of treatments - keratin, coloring, and blow-drying, for instance - that does the damage.</p>

<p><strong>The symptoms:</strong> If the fallout is occurring from external damage caused by styling, it will simply break, and you won't see those club-shaped telogen bulbs at the ends.</p>

<h3>Ayurvedic Tips for Healthy Joints</h3>  
  
<p>As we begin to understand how to maintain proper health and function of the joints, let us first look at their anatomy and physiology from an ayurvedic perspective. Joints hold the bones together and are designed to provide movement within the skeletal system. The main function of bone is support, while the joints allow a certain amount of flexibility and "give" to our structure. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synovial_joint">synovial</a> joints, where the ends of bone are connected by a joint cavity or capsule containing synovial fluid, allow freedom and fluidity in the articulation of our movements.  
</p>  
<p>All of the supportive tissues, bones, ligaments, tendons, and connective tissue, are kapha dosha, while the joint cavity or space where the bones meet is an element ruled by vata dosha. The joint capsule provides a container for the slippery synovial fluid, again a kapha substance, that lubricates the ends of the bone surfaces and also accommodates a tough, protective covering into which the ligaments and tendons can insert themselves. It is through the ligaments that nerve impulses are transmitted to the muscles signaling movement, a function of vata dosha</p>

<h3>Ayurvedic Tips for Healthy Joints</h3>  
  
<p>Healthy joint tissue and function are crucial to how we move and express ourselves through our bodies. According to ayurveda, vitiated or disturbed vata dosha can create imbalance within the joints resulting in pain and discomfort. Most commonly affected joints are knees, ankles, elbows, wrists, fingers and toes. When there is an imbalance in the joints, it is important to discern whether or not the imbalance exists with or without ama, a sticky toxic substance. A simple test can be done with organic sesame oil. Massage the oil into the joint. If the symptoms are aggravated, then there is ama present, a condition known as amavata. If the symptoms are alleviated by the oil massage or stay the same, then the treatment will begin with the removal of the causative factors and balancing vata dosha.</p>

<h3>Ayurvedic Tips for Healthy Joints</h3>   
   
<p>The dryness of vata can deplete the lubricating qualities of kapha and joint surfaces can become rough and brittle. Common symptoms of vata imbalance in the joints are dryness, popping and cracking, and muscle tics and spasms. Some common causative factors are jogging, jumping, excessive exercise, injury, consuming too many dry foods, living in a cold, dry climate and irregular eating habits and lifestyle. Entering the vata season of life of fifty years and older will also increase vata dosha throughout the body. Particularly during the vata season of Fall, when the temperature becomes cold and the wind begins to blow, symptoms may become aggravated. Ayurveda offers simple guidelines and herbal remedies for supporting healthy function of the joints.</p>

<h3>Ayurvedic Tips for Healthy Joints</h3>   
   
<p>In a condition of amavata, ama is carried by misdirected or vitiated vata into general circulation throughout the body. When it interacts with the kapha in the joint spaces, the synovial fluid loses its’ highly viscous quality and changes into a sticky toxic substance. It can begin to block vital channels throughout the body that carry nutrients to the tissues and cause disfunction within the joint. The immune system can begin to attack the ama stored in the joints causing an inflammation of the joint lining. Inflamed tissue can result in symptoms of excess heat, redness, pain, stiffness, and swelling. Acute inflammation, if left untreated, can cause damage or injury to the joint and bone tissue resulting in a chronic condition. Untreated chronic inflammation can lead to degenerative disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Ama can be clotted together with dead cells which the immune system sweeps up. Because it can also be so deeply embedded within healthy tissue, the immune cells can become confused by the similarity to that which it has been scavenging, unable to properly identify the toxic invader from the healthy tissue; an "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoimmune_reaction">autoimmune</a>" reaction.</p>

<p><strong>Bone Health for Women</strong><br/><br/>  
It is vital to keep your bones healthy throughout life. Healthy bones provide a strong foundation, allowing mobility and protection from injury. They also serve as a bank for important minerals, such as calcium, that helps support numerous organs in our body.</p>     
    
<p>Bone health in women is a pressing issue as women's bones are by nature less dense. A woman must be careful about the food she eats and her general state of health to make sure that her body is not deprived of vital nutrients critical to good bone health.

<p><strong>Summer Tips</strong></p>   
                      
<p>Pitta is the element that governs metabolism and transformation in the body, including digestion. Signs of excess Pitta include heartburn, excessive body heat and sweating, skin rashes, acne, excess stomach acidity, peptic ulcers, early graying, irritability and anger. These appear to be very disparate problems, but from the Ayurvedic perspective, measures to "pacify" Pitta can wipe out many of them.</p>         
<p>There are simple things you can do to pacify Pitta will help you enjoy summer more and ensure that the excess heat does not create imbalance in mind and body.</p>

<p><strong>Enjoy cooling summer beverages</strong></p>

<p>Cool liquids help pacify Pitta. But don't reach for that ice-cold drink or that carbonated beverage, because those will disrupt your digestion. Drink sweet fruit juices (sweet grape or sweet pineapple are refreshing choices), boiled and cooled milk with a pinch of cardamom or a little Organic Rose Petal Spread blended in it, or sweet lassi, made by blending one part fresh yogurt and three parts cool water, a heaped tablespoon or two of Organic Rose Petal Spread and a pinch of cooling cardamom (strain before drinking). Drink lots of cool pure water through the day to replenish moisture lost to heat. Pitta Tea is a refreshing summertime beverage for keeping body, mind and emotions cool.</p>

Avoid sour foods like sour cream, vinegar and ketchup and spicy dishes. Cook with cooling spices such as mint, fennel, anise and cardamom.

<h3>Tips for Staying Cool this Summer!</h3>                       
      
<p><strong>Summer Tips</strong></p>   
       
<p>There are simple things you can do to pacify Pitta will help you enjoy summer more and ensure that the excess heat does not create imbalance in mind and body.</p>

<p><strong>Use the rose for its cooling healing power</strong></p>

<p>In ayurveda, the rose is renowned for its powerful cooling effect on the physiology. Many ayurvedic herbal compounds that contain a high percentage of heating herbs are balanced with dried rose petals. The rose increases soma -- the cooling lunar energy element, to counter agni, the heating solar energy element, in the physiology. A spoonful of Organic Rose Petal Spread each day, either by itself, or blended into milk, is a delicious way to experience the cooling action of the rose. Try a rose aromatherapy skin care routine -- use the Rose Aromatherapy Bar for cleansing and Organic Rose Water as a pure toner. If your eyes burn from the heat or long hours at the computer, lie down for 10 minutes with Organic Rose Water soaked cotton wads on closed eyes and feel the tension flow away. Splash some Organic Rose Water in your bath.</p>

<p><strong>Hydrate often</strong></p>

<h3>Healthy Summer Diet</h3>                       
      
<p><strong>Water is the best option to quench thirst</strong></p>   
       
<p>It is a key ingredient in keeping the body cool. With high humidity levels, sweat will not evaporate quickly. This prevents the body from releasing heat in an efficient manner. This is why it is necessary to hydrate and drink water, even when you are not thirsty. Increase water intake regardless of your activity levels.</p>

<p><strong>Do not drink very chilled liquids.</strong></p>   
       
<p>They do not really help cool you down in summers, though they make you cool for some time. Drinking really cold liquids when feeling hot may lead to a slight constriction of the blood vessels in the skin and decrease heat loss, which is not advisable when trying to cool down.</p>

<h3>Healthy Summer Diet</h3>                       
      
<p><strong>Minimize the intake of hot, spicy foods and extremely salty foods.</strong></p>   
       
<p>The body retains salt in the organic form found in fruits and veggies; the inorganic salt, meanwhile, is digested and needs to be thrown out of the body. And this is why you need to drink water!</p>

<p><strong>Avoid sugary foods</strong> especially honey and molasses, and stick to natural sugars available from fruits and veggies.</p>

<h3>Healthy Summer Diet</h3>                          
         
<p><strong>Include salads in your diet</strong>. Consuming leafy lettuce and summer greens, corn on cob and cucumbers, in salads are delicious ways to stay cool. These foods contain a significant amount of water and can actually thin the blood, which has a cooling effect. Onions too are great in the summer, because of their ability to beat the heat and provide relief from summer ailments. So, throw in some washed onion slices onto a sandwich, or in your salad.</p>  
   
<p><strong>Eat light, small, frequent meals</strong>. Start the morning with a sweet, juicy fruit at breakfast. Ripe summer fruits - peaches, plums, melons and pears, are exactly what your skin craves for in the hot season. Citrus fruits are also very cooling. Eat whole or extract their juice, store in the refrigerator and sip often throughout the day </p>

<p><strong>Check out top ten why to Begin your Day with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya_Namaskar">Surya Namaskar</a></strong></p>       
       
<p>The obvious advantage of Surya Namaskar is the workout it provides for the muscles, but it also benefits joints, ligaments and the skeletal system by improving posture and balance. The limbs become symmetrical while the internal vital organs become more functional.</p>       
  
<p>Practicing Surya Namaskar is beneficial for the health of digestive system.  Yoga poses increase blood flow to your digestive tract and stimulate the intestinal action known as peristalsis so digestion is more efficient. Yoga also calms you, which in turn relaxes your digestive system and leads to more effective elimination. Forward bends increase the space in the abdomen and facilitate the release of entrapped gases. These poses heat the front of the body and cool the back body. For vatas, it is important to stay warm.</p>

<p><strong>Consciousness evolves:</strong> with the assimilation of meditation into daily life, your consciousness evolves and in time, is able to experience the higher and refined states of consciousness.</p>  
  
<p>When your consciousness evolves and expands, the disturbances in your life become negligible. Anger and disappointments become fleeting emotions that occur momentarily and then vanish. You start living in 'the moment' and let go of 'the past'.</p>  
  
<p><strong>Personal Transformation:</strong> meditation can bring about a true personal transformation. As you learn more about yourself, you?ll naturally want to discover more about the mystery of life, this universe, etc. Then the questions that arise in the mind are - What is the meaning of Life? What is its purpose? What is this world, what is love, what is knowledge...?</p>  
  
<p>Once these questions arise, know that you are very fortunate. These questions need to be understood; you cannot find the answers in books. As you live through answering them you?ll witness that life transformation to a richer level.</p>

<p><strong>Cosmic consciousness dawns in you</strong></p>  
  
<p>With the assimilation of meditation into daily life, the fifth state of consciousness, called cosmic consciousness, dawns. Cosmic consciousness - is to perceive the whole cosmos as part of oneself.</p>  
  
<p>When you perceive the world as a part of yourself, love flows strongly between the world and you. This love empowers you to bear the opposing forces and the disturbances in your life. Anger and disappointments become fleeting emotions that occur momentarily and then vanish. You start living in 'the moment' and let go of 'the past'.</p>  
  
<p>The confluence of knowledge, understanding and practice makes life complete. When you grow into higher states of consciousness, you become beautiful yet strong - a soft, delicate and beautiful blossom capable of accommodating different values in life without any conditions.</p>

<h3>How to Meditate</h3>                                                                                       
           
<p><strong>Prepare to Meditate</strong></p>    
    
<p><strong>Choose a peaceful environment.</strong> Meditation should be practiced somewhere calming and peaceful. This will enable you to focus exclusively on the task at hand and avoid bombarding your mind with outside stimuli. Try to find somewhere that you will not be interrupted for the duration of your meditation - whether it's five minutes or half an hour. The space does not need to be very large - a walk-in closet or even your office can be used for meditation, as long as it's somewhere private.</p>  
  
<p><ul>  
	<li>For those new to meditation, it's especially important to avoid any external distractions. Turn off TV sets, the phone or other noisy appliances. If you play music, choose calm, repetitive and gentle tunes, so as not to break your concentration. Another option is to turn on a small water fountain - the sound of running water can be extremely calming.</li>  
	<li>Understand that the meditation space does not need to be completely silent, so there should be no need to reach for the earplugs. The sound of a lawnmower running or the dog barking next door shouldn't prevent effective meditation. In fact, being aware of these noises but not letting them dominate your thoughts is an important component of successful meditation.</li>  
	<li>Meditating outside works for many meditators. As long as you don't sit near a busy roadway or another source of loud noise, you can find peace under a tree or sitting upon some lush grass in a favorite corner of the garden.</li>  
</ul>

<p><strong>2. Wear comfortable clothes</strong></p>      
      
<p>One of the major goals of meditation is to calm the mind and block out external factors - however, this can be difficult if you feel physically uncomfortable due to tight or restrictive clothing. Try to wear loose clothing during meditation practice and make sure to remove your shoes.</p>  
  
<p><ul>  
	<li>Wear a sweater or cardigan if you plan on meditating someplace cool. If you don't, the sensation of being cold will consume your thoughts and you will be tempted to cut your practice short.</li>  
	<li>If you are in the office, or somewhere that you can't easily change your clothes, do your best to make yourself as comfortable as possible. Take off your shoes and jacket, open the collar of your shirt or blouse and remove your belt.</li>

<p><strong>3. Decide how long you want to meditate for.</strong></p>        
        
<p>Before you begin, you should decide how long you are going to meditate for. While many seasoned meditators recommend twenty minute sessions twice a day, beginners can start out doing as little as five minutes, once a day.</p>    
    
<p><ul>    
	<li>You should also try to meditate at the same time each day - whether it's 15 minutes first thing in the morning, or five minutes on your lunch hour. Whatever time you choose, try to make meditation an unshakable part of your daily routine.</li> 
 
	<li>Once you have decided on a time frame, try to stick to it. Don't just give up because you feel like it isn't working - it will take time and practice to achieve successful meditation - right now, the most important thing is to keep trying.</li> 
 
	<li>Although you will want to keep track of your meditation time, it is not beneficial to be constantly checking your watch. Think about setting a gentle alarm to alert you when your practice is up, or time your practice to end with a certain event - such as your partner getting out of bed, or the sun hitting a certain spot on the wall. </li>

<p><strong>4. Stretch out.</strong></p>          
          
<p>Meditation involves sitting in one spot for a certain period of time, so it is important to minimize any tension or tightness before you begin. Doing a couple of minutes of light stretching can really help to loosen you up and prepare both your body and mind for meditation. It will also prevent you from focusing on any sore spots instead of relaxing your mind.</p>      
      
<p><ul>      
	<li>Remember to stretch your neck and shoulders, especially if you've been sitting in front of a computer, and don't forget your lower back. Stretching out your legs, particularly those on the inner thigh, can be helpful when meditating in the lotus position.</li>

<p><strong>5. Sit in a comfortable position.</strong></p>            
            
<p>It is very important that you are comfortable while you meditate, which is why finding the best position for you is essential. Traditionally, meditation is practiced by sitting on a cushion on the ground, in a lotus, or half-lotus position. Unless your legs, hips, and low back are very flexible, lotus postures tend to bow your low back and prevent you from balancing your torso around your spine. Choose a posture that allows you to be balanced tall and straight.</p>        
        
<p><ul>        
	<li>However, you can also sit without crossing your legs, on a cushion, chair, or meditation bench. Your pelvis needs to be tilted forwards enough for your spine to be centered over the two bony bits in your butt, the spots that bear your weight. To tilt your pelvis into the right position, sit on the forward edge of a thick cushion, or place something about 3 or 4 inches thick under the back legs of a chair. Meditation benches are usually built with a tilted seat. If not, put something under it to tilt it forward between a half inch and an inch.</li>    
	<li>The most important thing is that you are comfortable, relaxed, and your torso is balanced so that your spine supports all of your weight from the waist up.</li>

	<li>Tilt your pelvis forward. Then, starting from your bottom, stack up the vertebrae in your spine, so that they are balanced one on top of another and support the whole weight of your torso, neck, and head. It requires practice to find the position that allows you to relax your whole torso almost completely, only slight effort being used to maintain your balance. Whenever you feel tension, relax the area. If you can't relax it without slumping, check the alignment of your posture and seek to re-balance your torso so that area can relax.</li>        
	<li>The traditional hand placement involves resting your hands in your lap, palms facing upward, with your right hand on top of your left. However, your can also just rest your hands on your knees or leave them hanging down by your side - whichever you prefer.</li>

<p><strong>6. Close your eyes.</strong></p>                  
                  
<p>Meditation can be performed with the eyes open or closed, however as a beginner it may be best to first try meditating with your eyes closed. This will block out any external visual stimulation and prevent you from becoming distracted as you focus on calming your mind.</p>              
              
<p><ul>              
	<li>Once you have grown accustomed to meditation, you can try practicing with your eyes open. This can be helpful if you find you are either falling asleep or concentrating too hard with your eyes closed, or if you are experiencing disturbing mental images (which happens to a small proportion of people)</li>          
	<li>When your keep your eyes open, you will need to keep them "soft" - that is, not focused on anything in particular. However, you don't want to go into a trance-like state either - the goal is to feel relaxed but alert</li>

<p>Follow your breathing. The most basic and universal of all meditation techniques, breathing meditation is a great place to start your practice. Pick a spot above your navel and focus on that spot with your mind. Become aware of the rising and falling of your abdomen as you breathe in and out.

	<li>Some mental images which might help you include: imagining a coin sitting on the spot above your navel, rising and falling with your breath; imagining a buoy floating in the ocean, bobbing up and down with the swell and lull of your breathing; or imagining a lotus flower sitting in your belly, unfurling its petals with every intake of breath.</li>          
	<li>Don't worry if your mind starts to wander - you are a beginner and, like anything, becoming good at meditation takes practice. Just make an effort to refocus your mind on your breathing and try to think of nothing else. Drown out the chatter and attempt to clear your mind.</li>

<p><strong>Repeat a mantra.</strong></p>                    
                    
<p>Mantra meditation is another common form of meditation, which involves repeating a mantra (a sound, word or phrase) over and over, until you silence the mind and enter a deep meditative state. The mantra can be anything you choose, as long as it is easy to remember.</p>                
                
<p><ul>                
	<li>Some good mantras to start out with include words like one, peace, calm, tranquil, and silence. If you want to use more traditional mantras, you can use the word "Om" which symbolizes omnipresent consciousness, or the phrase "Sat, Chit, Ananda" which means "Existence, Consciousness, Bliss".</li>            
	<li>In Sanskrit, the word mantra means "instrument of the mind". The mantra is an instrument which creates vibrations in the mind, allowing you to disconnect from your thoughts and enter a deeper state of consciousness.</li>

<p> In a similar way to using a mantra, you can use a simple visual object to fill your mind and allow you to reach a level of deeper consciousness. This is a form of open-eye meditation, which many people find easier when they have something to focus their gaze on.</p>                         
                         
<p><ul>                         
	<li>The visual object can be anything you wish, though many people find the flame of a lit candle particularly pleasant. Other possible objects include crystals, flowers, and pictures or statues of divine beings, such as the Buddha.</li>                     
	<li>Place the object at eye level, so you don't need to strain your head and neck to view it. Gaze at it and nothing else, until your peripheral vision starts to dim and the object consumes your vision.</li>             
	<li>Once you are focused entirely on the object, with no other stimuli reaching your brain, you should feel a sense of profound serenity.</li>        
</ul>

<p><strong>Practice visualization.</strong></p>                             
                             
<p>Visualization is another popular meditation technique, which involves creating a peaceful place in your mind and exploring it, until you reach a state of complete calm. The place can be anywhere you like - however, it should not be entirely real, it should be unique and personalized for you.</p>                         
                         
<p><ul>                         
	<li>The place you visualize could be a warm, sandy beach, a flower-filled meadow, a quiet forest or even a comfortable sitting room with a roaring fire. Whatever place you choose, allow it to be your sanctuary.</li>                     
	<li>Once you have entered your sanctuary, allow yourself to explore. There's no need to "create" your surroundings, they are already there. Allow them to come to the forefront of your mind.</li>             
	<li>ake in the sights, sounds and scents of your surroundings - feel the fresh breeze against your face, or the heat of the flames warming your body. Enjoy the space for as long as you wish, allowing it to naturally expand and become more tangible. When you are ready to leave, take a few deep breaths, then open your eyes.</li>     
	<li>Know that you can come back to this same place the next time you meditate to visualization, or you can simply create a new space. Any space you create will be unique to you and a reflection of your individual personality.</li>   
   
</ul>

<p><strong>Do a body scan.</strong></p>                              
                              
<p>Doing a body scan involves focusing on each individual body part in turn and consciously relaxing it. It is a simple meditation technique which allows you to relax the mind as you relax the body.</p>                          
                          
<p><ul>                          
	<li>Close your eyes and pick a starting point on your body, usually the toes. Concentrate on whatever sensations you can feel in your toes, and make a conscious effort to relax any contracted muscles and release any tension or tightness. Once the toes are fully relaxed, move on to your feet and repeat the relaxation process.</li>                      
	<li>Continue along your body, moving upwards from your feet to your calves, knees, thighs, buttocks, hips, abdomen, chest, back, shoulders, arms, hands, fingers, neck, face, ears and top of your head. Take as long as you want.</li>              
	<li>Once you have completed the relaxation of each individual body part, focus on your body as a whole and enjoy the sensation of calmness and looseness you have achieved. Focus on your breathing for several minutes before coming out of your meditation practice.</li>      
</ul>

<p><strong>Try heart chakra meditation.</strong></p>                                
                                
<p>The heart chakra is one of seven chakras, or energy centers, located within the body. The heart chakra is located in the center of the chest and is associated with love, compassion, peace and acceptance. Heart chakra meditation involves getting in touch with these feelings and sending them out into the world.</p>                            
                            
<p><ul>                            
	<li>To begin, close your eyes and rub the palms of your hands together to create warmth and energy. Then, place your right hand on the center of your chest, over your heart chakra, and place the left hand on top.</li>                        
	<li>Take a deep breath and as you exhale, say the word "yum", which is the vibration associated with the heart chakra. As you do this, imagine a glowing green energy radiating from your chest and into your palms.</li>                
	<li>This green energy is love, life and whatever other positive emotions you are feeling at that moment. When you are ready, take your hands from your chest and allow the energy to escape from your palms, sending your love to your loved ones and the world.</li>        
	<li>Feel your body from the inside. Can you feel the energy field in your body, especially in your arms and legs if you don't feel it, its fine. But think how are we able to move different parts of the body Its the energy field that flows in our body. Focus your attention on that energy field it would not only help you stay in the present but also would help you connect with your Being and flow of life in you.</li>  
  
</ul>

<p><strong>Try walking meditation.</strong></p>                                  
                                  
<p>Walking meditation is alternate form of meditation which involves observing the movement of the feet and becoming aware of your body's connection to the earth. If you plan on performing long, seated meditation sessions, it is a good idea to break them up up with some walking meditation.</p>                              
                              
<p><ul>                              
	<li>Choose a quiet location to practice your walking meditation, with as few distractions as possible. The space doesn't need to be very large, but you should be able to walk at least seven paces in a straight line before needing to turn around. Remove your shoes, if possible.</li>                          
	<li>Holding your head up with your gaze directed straight ahead, and your hands clasped together in front of you, take a slow, deliberate step with your right foot. Forget about any sensations or feelings in the foot and try to concentrate on the movement itself. After taking the first step, stop for a moment before taking the next. Only one foot should be moving at any given time.</li>                  
	<li>When you reach the end of your walking path, stop completely, with your feet together. Then, pivot on the right foot and turn around. Continue walking in the opposite direction, using the same slow, deliberate movements as before.</li>          
	<li>While practicing walking meditation, try to focus on the movement of the feet and nothing else, in the same way that you focus on the rising and falling of your breath during breathing meditation. Try to clear your mind and become aware of the connection between your foot and the earth below.</li>    
    
</ul>                              
</p>

<p><ul>                                  
	<li>For example, in moments of stress, try to take a few seconds to focus solely on your breathing and empty your mind of any negative thoughts or emotions.</li>

<p>It is important that you make an effort to do your meditation practice at the same time each day. This way, the meditation will quickly become a part of your everyday routine and you will feel its benefits much more profoundly.</p>

<p>The purpose of meditation is to calm the mind, achieve inner peace and, eventually, reach a higher spiritual dimension, often referred to simply as being.</p>                  
<p><ul>     
	<li>However, it is important to realize that it may take years of practice to achieve the level of awareness or higher consciousness experienced by yogis and monks. This does not matter.</li>     
	<li>Meditation is a journey, akin to climbing a mountain, where every step along the path of enlightenment brings you closer to the summit.</li>  
	<li>When starting off, you shouldn't be too concerned with the quality of the meditation itself. As long as you feel calmer, happier and more at peace at the end of your practice, you will know that your meditation was successful.</li>

<p>Weight loss, a strong and flexible body, glowing beautiful skin, peaceful mind, good health ? whatever you may be looking for, yoga has it on offer. However, very often, yoga is only partially understood as being limited to asanas (yoga poses). As such, its benefits are only perceived to be at the body level and we fail to realize the immense benefits yoga offers in uniting the body, mind and breath. When you are in harmony, the journey through life is calmer, happier and more fulfilling. </p>

It is a dynamic expression of life ? in terms of how joyful, loving and enthusiastic you are." This is where yoga helps: postures, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pranayama">pranayama</a> (breathing techniques) and meditation are a holistic fitness package.</li>

	<li><strong>Living with greater awareness. </strong>The mind is constantly involved in activity ? swinging from the past to the future ? but never staying in the present. By simply being aware of this tendency of the mind, we can actually save ourselves from getting stressed or worked up and relax the mind. Yoga and pranayama help create that awareness and bring the mind back to the present moment, where it can stay happy and focused. </li>     
	<li><strong>Better relationships.</strong> Do you feel completely drained out by the end of the day? Shuttling between multiple tasks through the day can sometimes be quite exhausting. A few minutes of yoga everyday provides the secret to feeling fresh and energetic even after a long day. A 10-minute online guided meditation benefits you immensely, leaving you refreshed and recharged in the middle of a hectic day. </li>

<h3>Health Benefits of Yoga</h3>                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                           
<p><strong>Depression</strong>                     
</p>                 
<p>Low brain levels of the neurotransmitter GABA are often found in people with depression; SSRIs, electroconvulsive therapy, and now yoga, it seems, can boost GABA. Preliminary research out of the Boston University School of Medicine and Harvard's McLean Hospital found that healthy subjects who practiced yoga for one hour had a 27 percent increase in levels of GABA compared with a control group that simply sat and read for an hour. This supports a growing body of research that's proving yoga can significantly improve mood and reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety.</p>

</p>                     
<p>Certain yoga asanas, if practiced regularly, are known to have beneficial effects on human body. Researchers at the University College of Medical Sciences, in Shahdara, New Delhi, India evaluated 24 patients aged 30 to 60 year old who had non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, also called Type II diabetes. Diabetics who require insulin are called Type I, while Type II diabetics are treated with diet, exercise, and oral medicines that lower blood sugar. The researchers evaluated the baseline fasting blood sugar levels of the patients, and they also performed pulmonary function studies. These pulmonary function studies measure lung capacity and the amount of air that can be exhaled within the first second of a rapid exhale.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavasana">Shavasana</a></strong></p>                 
                
<p><strong>What is Shavasana?</strong><br/> </p>               
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavasana">Shavasana </a>also known as Mrta-asana or "Corpse Pose" is an ultimate relaxing pose that is mainly practiced as a concluding asana at any yoga session. The word Mrta and Shava refers to dead body in Sanskrit. In this pose one loosens all his limbs and lie motionless as a dead person thus the name Shavasana. It is one of the most difficult to master poses because though lying relaxed and motionless one should be fully conscious and awaken. The "conscious" part of Shavasana is the most difficult because people tend to drift off to sleep while doing Shavasana. This relaxing posture rejuvenates one's body, mind and spirit.</p>              
              
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>            
<p>Start with sitting in Dandasana with your legs stretched in front and hands resting on your sides. Then bend your knees and move your torso backward while resting your elbows on the floor. Rest your torso with arms at a 45-degree angle to your torso and palms facing up. Now extend your legs slightly apart with your feet naturally falling to either side. Now relax completely. The back of the neck should be extended, chin slightly tucked in toward the chest, lengthening the upper spine.</p> 
<p>Take care that the spine and legs are aligned and that you are evenly relaxed on the right and left sides. If this pose is done at the end of a session, remain in Shavasana for about five minutes, breathing easily. To come out of the position without disturbing your peaceful state, stretch out your body and take a deep breath. Roll onto your side into the fetal position, then gradually ease your way up to a sitting or standing position, moving slowly without any sudden or jerky movements.      
</p>                
                
<p><strong>Benefit</strong><br/></p>                
<p>It is an ultimate relaxing pose that provides relaxation to mind and body as well. It calms the brain and helps relieve stress and mild depression. It reduces headache, fatigue, nervousness and helps to cure asthma, constipation, diabetes, indigestion, insomnia, and lumbago. It improves concentration also.

<p><strong>Setu Bandha Sarvangasana</strong></p>                 
                
<p><strong>What is Setu Bandha Sarvangasana?</strong><br/> </p>               
<p>In Sanskrit, setu means bridge, bandha means energy-binder that directs subtle energy flow and sarvanga means whole body (balanced on shoulders and neck). Thus literally, Setu bandha Sarvangasana means a bridge that flows the energy into body. Also known as the Little Bridge or bridge pose, this asana calms the brain and rejuvenates tired legs.</p>              
              
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>            
<p>Start by lying on your back, with your knees bent and the soles of your feet on the ground. Keep your feet apart and parallel. Bring your heels in as close to your hips as you can. Rest your arms at your sides with the palms of your hands facing downwards. Inhaling, press down on your feet and start by pressing your navel toward the ground as you begin to raise your hips upward. Then gradually allow the middle and upper sections of your spine to rise. Raise your spine off the ground until the thighs are about parallel to the floor. Hold this position for four to eight breaths for the static version. You can place your hands under your lower back for support, keeping your elbows resting on the ground. Alternatively, move on with the dynamic version, exhaling as you return to the starting position. Repeat, moving in and out of the Little Bridge while inhaling and exhaling.</p> 
                
<p><strong>Benefit</strong><br/></p>                
<p>This asana is good for mind and body as well. It stretches the chest, neck, and spine and stimulates abdominal organs, lungs, and thyroid. It is an excellent rejuvenator for tired legs.  It improves digestion, reduces anxiety, fatigue, backache, headache, and insomnia. It is a good asana for women as it helps to relieve the symptoms of menopause and menstrual discomfort. It is a therapeutic posture for asthma, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and sinusitis. It also calms the brain and helps alleviate stress and mild depression.</p>

		<li>Avoid drinking tea (regular, not herbal varieties) and coffee immediately after meals, as the tannin present in these interferes in the absorption of iron from the food.</li>  
	<li>Drink a cup of herbal tea mixed with 1/4 cup blackstrap molasses each day. This provides 80% of the iron needed in one day.</li>  
	<li>Foods rich in iron: shellfish, fish, liver, organ meats, egg yolks, pinto, kidney, lima, navy, chick peas, black-eyed peas, lentils, split peas, green peas, spinach, kale, collards, beet greens, chard, broccoli, raisins, prunes, figs, dates, dried peaches, dried apricots, nuts, peanut butter, whole grain breads.</li>

You can  add cinnamon, clove, or the juice of 2 lemons, if you like. </li>
</ul>

<p>Only 2 remedies  have I ever know to actually work. The first listed makes the most sense, since  a hiccups is simply a spasm of the diaphragm, and you need to disrupt this  spasm. The second offers no rhyme or reason, but works nonetheless. </p>
<ul>
<li>Breath in as deeply       as you can, then exhale as hard as you can; repeat 10 times; when exhaling       the last time, keep the air pushed out, not taking another breath for as       long as you can stand. This normally works the first try, but repeat if       necessary. Be sure to sit down when doing this. </li>
<li>This is a       remedy only feasible when sitting at a bar.&nbsp;Have the bartender fill a small glass with club       soda. Light a match and drop it, then drink the water quickly (being       careful not to drink the match). It works, but I don't know why! </li>
<li>Drink 1/2 glass       water, slowly. </li>
<li>Keep a tsp. of sugar       in your month and suck slowly. </li>
<li>Suck 2-3 small       pieces of fresh ginger. </li>
</ul></p>

<p>Everyday two cycles of change passes through us, each bringing a Vata, Pitta or Khapa predominance.</p>

<h4>DINNER and BED TIME </h4>
            <p>6-7 P.M. It should be taken around 6 – 7 P.M. It should be lighter than the lunch. The dinner should be at least three hours before bedtime, as it gives the body ample time to digest the food. Sleeping just after the dinner with a heavy stomach is not conducive to a sound sleep. Go to bed in time, so that you can get 6 to 7 hours of sleep before 4:30 am. A good practice is to massage the soles of your feet, before going to bed. This will calm your system. Do not sleep on your belly, but try to sleep on your back with knees slightly bent.</p>
